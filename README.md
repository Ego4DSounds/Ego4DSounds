# Ego4DSounds
Ego4DSounds is a subset of Ego4D, an existing large-scale egocentric video dataset. Videos have a high action-audio correspondence, making it a high-quality dataset for action-to-sound generation.

## Action2Sound

Dataset introduced in _"Action2Sound: Ambient-Aware Generation of Action Sounds from Egocentric Videos"_.

Action2Sound is an ambient-aware approach that disentangles the action sound from the ambient sound, allowing successful generation after training with diverse in-the-wild data, as well as controllable conditioning on ambient sound levels.

## Contents

This repository contains scripts for processing the Ego4DSounds dataset. It includes functionality for loading video and audio data and extracting clips using metadata.

- `extract_ego4d_clips.py`: Extracts clips from the Ego4D dataset
- `dataset.py`: Defines the Ego4DSounds dataset class for loading and processing video and audio clips
- Metadata files: `train_clips_1.2m.csv`, `test_clips_11k.csv`, `ego4d.json`

Each row in the csv files has the following columns
```
video_uid, video_dur, narration_source, narration_ind, narration_time, clip_start, clip_end, clip_text, tag_verb, tag_noun, positive, clip_file, speech, background_music, traffic_noise, wind_noise
```
